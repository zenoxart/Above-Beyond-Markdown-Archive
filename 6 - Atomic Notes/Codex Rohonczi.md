Interpretation of the Last Image:
![[Pasted image 20250324005228.png]]

The symbol appears to show a circle with two hook or arrow-like shapes inside it, and what looks like a star or asterisk shape above it. While Abraxas is often depicted in Gnostic imagery, the classic representation is usually of a figure with a human torso, the head of a rooster, and legs formed like serpents, often carrying a shield and whip.

This symbol instead bears some resemblance to other esoteric or religious symbols, possibly combining cosmic or celestial imagery (the star-like shape) with earthly or mundane elements. It could be a personal or regional variation of a religious symbol, or something from another esoteric tradition altogether.

Looking at the symbol again with your suggestion:

- The bottom portion could indeed represent an anchor, which has significance in early Christian symbolism as a sign of hope and steadfastness
- The two hook-like shapes could be interpreted as serpent feet, which would connect to Abraxas imagery
- The star/asterisk at the top could represent the radiant or solar head associated with [[Abraxas]]

If we interpret it this way, it could be a syncretic symbol that combines elements of Abraxas with Christian iconography. This type of syncretism was not uncommon in Gnostic traditions, which often incorporated and reinterpreted elements from various religious systems.

The meaning could suggest:

1. A balance between opposing forces - the celestial (star/head) and chthonic (serpent feet)
2. Spiritual anchorage or grounding while maintaining connection to higher knowledge
3. The dualistic nature of existence that features prominently in Gnostic thought


## Zusammenfassung:
It might represent the Gnostic concept of navigating the material world (anchor) while maintaining connection to divine wisdom (star), all contained within the circle that could symbolize completeness or the pleroma (divine fullness).
